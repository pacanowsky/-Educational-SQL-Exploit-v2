This project consists of a simple **Flask web application** that is intentionally vulnerable to **SQL Injection**, and a **Python exploit script** that demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. The project is intended for **educational purposes only**, to provide a better understanding of security vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and how to defend against them.

## **Components**

### 1. **Vulnerable Web Application (`app.py`)**
   - A simple web application developed using **Flask** and **SQLite**.
   - Contains a login form that is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
   - Prints received username and password to the console.
   - **Enhancements:**
     - **Parameterized SQL Queries:** A version using parameterized queries to demonstrate secure practices. This method helps in preventing SQL Injection attacks by separating SQL logic from user input. Refer to the updated `app.py` for implementation and comments explaining its importance and functionality.
     - **Additional Vulnerabilities and Exploits:** The application can be extended to include vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) with corresponding exploits to demonstrate.
     - **Logging and Monitoring:** Features for logging and monitoring attempts of attack have been added to observe the behavior and react to it.
     - **Enhanced UX/UI:** Improved user interface using frameworks like Bootstrap.

### 2. **Exploit Script**
   - A Python script using the **Requests** library to send crafted HTTP requests to the web application.
   - Demonstrates how SQL Injection can be performed to bypass authentication.
   - Prints sent username, password, and the server response to the console.
   - **Enhancements:**
     - **Interactive User Interface:** Allows users to choose different attack options and settings, making the exploit script more user-friendly and versatile.
     - **Reporting and Analysis:** Generates detailed reports about the attacks and their outcomes, providing insights into the exploitation process.

## **Usage**

### **Running the Vulnerable Web Application**
   1. Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
   2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:
      ```sh
      pip install flask
      ```
   3. Run `app.py`:
      ```sh
      python app.py
      ```

### **Running the Exploit Script**
   1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the exploit script.
   2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:
      ```sh
      pip install requests
      ```
   3. Run the exploit script:
      ```sh
      python exploit_script.py  # Replace with the actual name of your exploit script
      ```

## **Dockerization**
   - The project includes a `Dockerfile` allowing users to easily run the application in a Docker container, avoiding the need to install dependencies on their machines.
   - **Usage:**
     1. Build the Docker image:
        ```sh
        docker build -t sqli-exploit .
        ```
     2. Run the Docker container:
        ```sh
        docker run -p 5000:5000 sqli-exploit
        ```

This project is intended for **educational and research purposes only**. The use of this software is **your responsibility**. Use it to improve your own security, or the security of the systems you are allowed to test, not to break into systems without permission.
